"React JS Setup, Installation and First React Project Creation" by kudvenkat at https://youtu.be/0twjvW0c1r0

1. Download nodejs and npm (LTS version) via https://nodejs.org/en/ 
2. Download Visual Studio Code via https://code.visualstudio.com/download

*Creation Process:

This React-based web application was created by running the command "npx create-react-app sports_saftey" within a terminal

via instruction from https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

*How to Start the web application:

Open Visual Studio Code, Click File, Open Folder, select the project's base folder (sports_saftey)

Open a terminal within VSCode by clicking Terminal, New terminal 

run "npm install" to install all dependencies, if this fails, delete the node_modules folder and run "npm install"

The Project can be hosted locally on http://localhost:3000/

To start the project, change directories (cd) into the project's base folder via the terminal (sports_saftey),
then run the command "npm start", this should spawn a browser tab that shows the application running within the browser.
The project's code can be updated and recompiled in realtime when it is saved within VSCode.

*Browser inspector console:

To pull up your browser dev console right click your screen and select inspect,
this powerful tool is very useful for debugging and viewing compile and runtime errors

*Adding packages to your project:

Use npm install (package name) to add packages to your project (seen within the node_modules folder and listed inside of package.json folder) 

Happy developing :)
